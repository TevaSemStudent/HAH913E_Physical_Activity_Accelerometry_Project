# Physical Activity - Accelerometry Project : Kinovea Video Analysis 

## Tools : 

Jump height is assessed from a video recording, an-
alyzed using Kinovea software. Kinovea is a free and open-
source two-dimensional motion analysis software specifically
designed for video analysis in sports contexts. A video cam-
era (4k/60FPS) is positioned in profile, at a sufficient distance
to capture the entire body during the jump. The camera frame
rate is chosen to allow for precise identification of the takeoff, jump, and landing phases.

# Physical Activity - Accelerometry Project

This is a project for the Health - Physical Activity module of the Master Digital Sciences for Health at the University of Montpellier.

Using accelerometry data and video, we aim to compare the effects of arms movement during a vertical jump on the height reached.

## Installation

Clone the repository on your machine using Git or simply download the compressed folder. No additional steps are required.

## Usage

The jupyter notebook main.ipynb contains all the code regarding the physical acceleration study. The data file contains all acceleration data recorded and studied during the project, some in raw sensor units (1/256 g) and some in g, as well as a video of a jump sequence for jump height and flight time analysis.

## Contributing

This project is open source. Feel free to use the code and data for your own projects.
